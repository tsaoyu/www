<h1>Hydro Contest</h1>
</div>
<p>Hydro Contest is the first international student competition dedicated to naval energy efficiency. Student teams from different countries join this competition with their own design. And they need build their own boat(s) to compete in three categories: light weight speed race, heavy weight speed race and long distance race. Each teams were given the same battery and engine for their boat. The fastest team get the prize for the speed race, and most endurance team the get the distance race prize.</p>

<td align="left"><p>In 2015, seven of us with different background (in naval architecture, computation fluid dynamic, yacht design, ocean engineering and marine engineering) voluntarily formed a team. We represent University of Southampton as the first UK team in this competition. I was working on electrical system including radio control system, rudder actuator and engine speed controller.</p>
<p>Our boat is shown on the left. This hydrofoil catamaran was initially designed as luxury yacht by Pietro and Matthieu as their final design project in Solent University. To overcome logistic difficulty, hydrofoil for lightweight race is interchangeable with a underwater pod for heavy weight race. A single pod can carry to up 100 kg payload. The electrical engine was integrated with rudder like a Z-pod. It was the fastest and lightest boat on the water.</p>

<td align="left"><p>Based on the lessons we have learnt in 2015, we completely redesign the structure of central pod to deal with transverse strength issue. And I help to design a more reliable electronic system to address overheat issue. Our team applied the most cutting technology including autopilot system and real-time video transmission system on board.</p>
<p>Among 22 teams in this edition, we are:</p>
<p>Lightweight race: 6th</p>
<p>Heavyweight race: 4th</p>
<p>Endurance race: 4th</p>
<p>Communications Prize Winners</p>
