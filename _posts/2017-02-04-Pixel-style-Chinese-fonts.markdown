title: Pixel fonts for Chinese characters
category: posts
---

This lovely pixelized Jekyll site remind me of my early-days programming experience with Q Basic on a MS-DOS machine. But one thing missing here is a proper Chinese fonts to mimic the fully old-school  computer style.

After a bit of search, I found a 8-bit Chinese fonts, [Founder's Feng](http://ifont.foundertype.com/showsortpic.php?sid=1106) Dot Fonts, in a good match with my flavor.

To display non-ASCII characters 像素字体, font resources are necessary to support browser to render the right Chinese characters.

The issue is Chinese, Japanese, Korean and some other Asian languages have a huge characters set. So the font resources file is much bigger than ACSII characters.

The personal non-commercial use license is priced at 2 CNY, but since it was not possible to purchase a license on this legacy online shop, I paid the license fee by ordered  [another fonts](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z09.2.0.0.sCErJX&id=17990674587&_u=5lefkln2b6c) at the same price.
