== Softwares

=== $D^3 HRE$
[https://github.com/tsaoyu/D3HRE $D^3 HRE$] (Data Driven Dynamic Hybrid Renewable Energy (D3HRE) is a software suite to study hybrid renewable energy system on moving platforms. This package enables the simulation, optimisation and management of spatial-temporal hybrid renewable energy system e.g. on ships, airballons and airplanes.  {{<a href="https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/129913383"><img src="https://zenodo.org/badge/129913383.svg" alt="DOI" width=160></a>}}
