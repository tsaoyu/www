My name is Yu Cao, third year PhD candidate at University of Southampton.

My research interests are in the field of long-term self-sustained autonomous robot systems. I am currently working on two related areas:
theoretical research on the hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) based power system and applied research on the autonomy of robotics.

The theoretical research on HRES addresses the long-term uninterrupted power supply issue of the robots which
cover the design, optimisation and management of power system on *moving* robots such as the surface vehicle, autonomous cars and drones. I extended my research interests to the autonomy of robotics with a particular emphasis on *maritime* robotics.

You can find more about my research on the left columns.
